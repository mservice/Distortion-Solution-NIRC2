\section{Observations}
Here we present the observations and reduction carried out for this work.  This reduction procedure mirrors the work of \cite{Yelda_2010} which derived a similar distortion solution.  
\subsection{M53}
Characterizing the geometric optical distortion in the NIIRC2 camera requires two sets of positions measurements.  Ideally positions measurements at the camera focal plane could be compared to a distortion free frame.  As no such reference frame exists, we use observations of M53 made with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Filed Channel (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope(HST).  the static distortion in the camera has been corrected to the $\sim$0.5 mas level.

M53 was observed on April 2, 2015 and May 5, 2015 using the laser AO system in the W.M. Kecj II 10 m telescope with the facility near infrared camera NIRC2 (PI: K.Matthews).  All of these observations were taken using the narrow field camera (10" x 10") through the K' filter ($\lambda_{0} = $ 2.12 $\mu$m, $\Delta\lambda =$ 0.35 $\mu$m).
